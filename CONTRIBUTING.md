Contributing
============

Feedback and pull-requests
--------------------------

For feature requests, bug reports, vulnerability reports, and feedback, please
provide them as GitHub issues.

To submit a patch please create a pull request from your topic branch.
You should create a separate branch for each single topic (bug fix or
new feature). Please follow commit message guideline from
[git-scm book](http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html). Try to break several
logical changes or bug fixes in several commits.

We also ask you to sign our [Contributor Licence Agreement](https://github.com/AdaCore/contributing-howto).

Code conventions
----------------

### pre-commit checks

Before contributing a change please activate pre-commit checks locally:

```bash

$ pip3 install pre-commit
$ pre-commit install
```

Note that the pre-commit check configuration can be found in ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``. Before any change to that file please run:

```bash
$ pre-commit run --all-files
```

The pre-commit checks will format the code with Black, run flake8 and mypy.

### Flake8, mypy, and Black

All code should follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/),
[PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). The code is automatically
formatted with Black at commit time.

All changes should contain type hinting and running mypy should be clean of
errors.

You should also document your method's parameters and their return values
in *reStructuredText* format:

```python
"""Doc string for function

:param myparam1: description for param1
:param myparam2: description for param1
:return: description for returned object
"""
```
The code is automatically formatted with Black.

### logger

All logging done by `e3` must be done via a logger returned by the function
`e3.log.getLogger`. Very verbose logging can be achieved by adding calls to
`e3.log.debug()`. This will be activated when an application using
`e3.main.Main` is run with: `-v -v`.

### Main

All entry points must instanciate `e3.main.Main` to parse their options.

### Exceptions

Exceptions raised by `e3` should derived from `e3.error.E3Error`.

### hasattr()

Don't use hasattr() - this swallows exceptions and makes debugging much
harder. Use getattr() instead.


The `e3` namespace
------------------

The `e3` framework provides a namespace package. It allows creating
separated packages living under the `e3` namespace.

Such a package must:

   * define an `e3/__init__.py` file containing **only**:

     ```python
     __import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__)
     ```

   * set to `e3` the value of the *namespace package* argument
     of the setup() function of its ``setup.py`` (see [setup.py](setup.py)).

See [setuptools namespace-packages doc][1] for more info.

Plugin system
-------------

`e3` uses a plugin system based on
[stevedore](https://github.com/openstack/stevedore) built on top of setuptools
entry points. `e3-core` is meant to be as small as possible and extented with
plugins.

To add a new feature based on plugins, first define a base class with
[abc (Abstract Base Classes)](https://docs.python.org/2/library/abc.html) that
will implement the plugin interface. Other packages can then create plugin by
deriving the base class (the interface) and referencing the entry point in its
``setup.py``. `e3-core` can then use the plugin via `stevedore`. See the
[plugin system documentation](https://github.com/AdaCore/e3-core/wiki/Plugins).

Documentation
-------------

All public API methods must be documented.

`e3-core` documentation is available in the [e3-core GitHub wiki](https://github.com/AdaCore/e3-core/wiki).

Testing
-------

All features or bug fixes must be tested. Make sure that pre-commit checks are activated before any pull-requests.

Requires: [tox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox)
If not already installed, install it via:

```bash
pip install tox
```

On Windows, you will need additional tools in your PATH to run the testsuite cleanly.
If you have installed Git and are using PowerShell, then you can add them by running:

```bash
$ENV:PATH += ";$ENV:ProgramFiles/Git/usr/bin"
```

In order to run the public testsuite of `e3-core`, do:

```bash
tox
```

Coverage
--------

The code needs to be covered as much as possible. We're aiming for 100%
coverage. If something cannot be tested on a platform add `no cover`
instruction in the code. This should be done for all platform specific code or for
defensive code that should never be executed. See the file `tests/coverage_<platform>.rc` for patterns to use in order to exclude some line from the coverage report.

Supported Python version
------------------------

To simplify our testing and reduce the technical debt, we are only supporting the two
last versions of Python.
